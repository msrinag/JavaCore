# Java OOP & Data Structures Practice  

This repository contains implementations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and data structure problems in Java. The code is structured into separate files for better organization.  

## ðŸ“Œ Contents  

### OOP Concepts  
Each OOP problem is implemented in an individual Java file:  

- **`Main1.java`** â€“ E-Commerce System
- **`Main2.java`** â€“ Employee Management System 
- **`Main3.java`** â€“ Banking System 
- **`Main4.java`** â€“  OnlineOrder
- **`Main5.java`** â€“ Inheritance 

### Data Structures & Algorithms  
All problems related to ArrayLists, LinkedLists, and Maps are implemented in **`Programs.java`**, covering:  

- Finding the **kth smallest** element in an `ArrayList`  
- Finding the **maximum** element in an `ArrayList`  
- Removing **duplicates** from an `ArrayList` (including Java 8 approach)  
- Finding the **intersection** of two `ArrayLists`  
- Counting word frequency using a **HashMap**  
- Reversing a **LinkedList** without built-in methods  
- Finding the **second largest** element in a list  
- Checking for **common elements** in two `HashSets`  
- Converting a **HashMap** to a `TreeMap` and sorting it  
- Counting character occurrences in a **String** using a `Map`

  Plz Note all questions are implemented as member fucntions.
  Thank you
